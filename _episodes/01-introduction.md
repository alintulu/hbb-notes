exercises: 0
questions:
- "Why do we need data-driven background estimations? What is the ABCD method?"
objectives:
- "Understand the motivation for data-driven background estimation"
- "Get a first idea of the ABCD method"
keypoints:
- "Data-driven background estimates are a must in situations where you cannot get a reliable estimate from simulation"
- "They are also useful to validate predictions from simulations"
- "The ABCD method is a common background estimated concept, based on four different regions in phase space"
- "In this method, background shape in the signal region is estimated using a control region"
- "Differences between the control region and signal region are accounted for by event weights called transfer factors"
